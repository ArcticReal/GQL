### How do I get set up? ###

This project uses npm and its node-fetch, babel and express-graphql modules. When changes are made, the `npm start` command will use babel to transpile the files in the src folder and put the transpiled files into the lib folder. If you simply want to start the server you can type `npm run-script run` but be careful as this will be ignoring any changes you made to the src files.
