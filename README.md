### How do I get set up? ###

This project uses npm and its node-fetch, babel and express-graphql modules. When changes are made, the `npm start` command will use babel to transpile the files in the src folder and put the transpiled files into the lib folder. If you simply want to start the server you can type `npm run-script run` but be careful as this will be ignoring any changes you made to the src files.


### Contribution guidelines ###

Changes will only be allowed to make to files in the src folder as the files in the lib folder will be created by babel and possibly overwritten.

### Usage tutorials ###

There is (or at least is going to be) a [wiki](#) that will show how to use this graphQl Server. It includes installation guides as well as tutorials on forming graphQl mutations and queries.
